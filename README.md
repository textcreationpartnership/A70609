1. Presbyterian Inquiſition,
AS
It was Practiſed by the Viſitors of the
Colledge at Edinburgh, in Their Proceedings
againſt ſome of the Maſters
there, in Auguſt and September, 1690.

    _ Articles of Inquiſition againſt
Dr. MONRO, to which he was made
to Anſwer before the Committee upon
the 27th of Auguſt, 1690.

    _ Anſwer to the Articles given
againſt Doctor Monro, upon the 27th
of Auguſt, 1690.

      * I. That I Renoimced the Proteſtant Religion, and Subſcrib'd
my ſelf a Papiſt, beyond Sea.

      * The ſecond Article, is a Confirmation of the firſt, Mr. Burnet,
was ſuſpect of Popery when he came here, and I did all
I could to get Scholars to his Claſs,Auditum admiſſi riſum te•nea•is amici. particularly I ſpoke to
Bailey Grahame for his Son, and the Chancellour thanked
me for the Care I took of Mr. Burnets Concern, and ſuch
as he was.

      * III. The next, is that formidable one, of Reading the Engliſh
Service in my Family, in that Interval, when there was no
National Church Government here.

      * IV. But I am (as it is ſaid) highly Diſaffected
to the Government in the
Church and State, as appears by a
Letter to the Arch-Biſhop of St. Andrews,
Dated January 5. 1689. Intercepted by
Hamilton of Kinkell.

A Second Inſtance of my being Diſaffected to the Government
of the State, is, That I dimitted my Charge in the
High Church, leſt I might be obliged to Pray for King
William and Queen Mary, &c.

The next is, That I Rojoyced upon the News of my Lord
Dundee His Victory.

The next Inſtance is, that I broke open Mr. James Ingliſh his
Chamber Door, and ejected him out of the Colledge, for
Preaching in a Meeting Houſe in Perth-ſhire.

The next Man I Perſecuted for being Presbyterian is Mr.
Gourlay, and his Perſecution did ſo exactly meet with the
time of his being Licenſed to Preach by the Presbytery; Mr.
Cuninghame and Mr. Kennedy's Scholars drove him from
his Chamber, and no redreſs of all this.

      * V. The next Accuſation is, that I heard Dr. Pitcairn at the
late Publick Commencement, Treat the Confeſſion of Faith
at Weſtminſter, in Ridicule, and Impugn the Exiſtence of a
Deity, without anſwering him.

      * VI. The next Crime is, I removed ſome Pictures of the firſt
Reformers, for a day or two, out of their place in the
Library, and that I was challenged for this by the Magiſtrates.

      * VII. The next is, that I preſented on Euchariſtick Poem, Compoſed
by Mr. Cuninghame, upon the Birth of the Prince of
Wales, to my Lord Chancellour with my own hand.

      * VIII. The next is a Horrid and Impious Curſe againſt my
ſelf, when I threatned one of the Scholars.

      * XI. The next is, That I ordinarily neglect the Worſhip of God
in my Family.

      * X. The next is, I Baptized upon Sunday laſt Mr. James Scot
his Child, without acquainting the Miniſter of the Weſt-Kirk.

    _ The Report of the Committee,
concerning Doctor MONRO.
At Edinburgh, September, 23, 1690.
